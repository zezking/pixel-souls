*"You and I, we're both Undead... Hear me out, will you?"*  
  
PIXEL-SOULS is a top-down pixelated RPG demo of DARK SOULS I, made as a final project for Lighthouse Labs' [Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en/web-development-bootcamp)! It is built using the [Phaser3](https://www.phaser.io/phaser3) engine, and utilizes [MatterJS](https://brm.io/matter-js) physics.
